Hello, My name is Artur, I'm 17 and I'm hobbyist programmer, I know C++ well, and basics of Python.
On GitHub I want to Upload my works on games, my codes of games or my any projects of games.
I'm writing alone, but maybe later I will find someone more for Programming together :D
My Big Dream is become a known programmer who is writing big games or programs in known business.
I'm working on Windows, but in near future I will work on linux.
Thanks for visiting, GL, HF and see ya :)
