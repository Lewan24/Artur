Hello, My name is Artur, I'm 17 and I'm hobbyist programmer, I know C++ well and SFML library, 
I know also Python but I'm still learning this language.
On GitHub I want to Upload my works on games, my codes of games or my any projects of games.
I'm writing alone, but maybe later I will find someone more for Programming together :D
My Big Dream is become a known programmer who is writing big games or programs in known business.
I'm working on Linux actually, but I didn't leave windows :D

Actual language: Python 3

Known language: C++ and SFML, HTML, CSS

Future languages: Library for python 3-PyGame, C#, Java (Maybe), PHP, MySQL, JavaScript
